## About Me
Hi! My name is Mariam Hersi. I am a Computer Science Undergraduate currently in my final year
with a passion for using technology to be a force for good. I have a
strong interest in software development and problem-solving using
various programming languages and collaborative teamwork. The
programming languages I learnt, have allowed me to use my projects as
my creative outlet. I am excited at the prospect of leveraging my skills
to help improve communities and make an impact.

*Below I will highlight some of my best projects:*

**Created my own DBMS:**
    - •	Using MySQL, I created a database management system. I created it for my chosen business, a retail company that sells perfumes. It sells its product online and in store with many branches all over London. I optimized SQL queries for faster product search, and designed ER diagrams for better data visualization.
     
**Data Science Project:**
    - As part of my second-year coursework, I used healthcare datasets, such as diabetes and breast cancer data, to predict disease outcomes. I applied classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, utilizing Python (Pandas, scikit-learn) for data cleaning, analysis, and modelling. This project allowed me to deliver insights relevant to healthcare decision-making and showcased my ability to work with complex data in real-world contexts.
      
**Medical Image Classification:**
    - •	I developed an image classification model using deep learning techniques to classify diseases from medical imaging datasets, such as X-rays and MRI scans. Utilizing Python and TensorFlow/Keras, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in classifying images, showcasing my proficiency in machine learning and deep learning.
