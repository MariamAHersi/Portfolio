## About Me
Hi! My name is Mariam Hersi. I am a Computer Science Undergraduate currently in my final year
with a passion for using technology to be a force for good. I have a
strong interest in software development and problem-solving using
various programming languages and collaborative teamwork. The
programming languages I learnt, have allowed me to use my projects as
my creative outlet. I am excited at the prospect of leveraging my skills
to help improve communities and make an impact.

*Below I will highlight some of my best projects:*

**Created my own DBMS:**
    - Using MySQL, I created a database management system. I created
      it for my chosen business, a retail company that sells perfumes. It
     sells its product online and in store with many branches all over
     London.
     
**Created a self-checkout system:**
    - I used C++ and it involves designing a program that simulates the
      process of a self-checkout system found in stores.
      
**Wrote a report on User Research:**
    - I wrote a report on my findings from conducting user research
    methods, such as interviews, creating a persona and a usability
    test, on the collaboration tool Google Docs.
