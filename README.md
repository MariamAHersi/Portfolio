## About Me
Hi! My name is Mariam Hersi. I am a Computer Science Undergraduate currently in my final year
with a passion for using technology to be a force for good. I have a
strong interest in software development and problem-solving using
various programming languages and collaborative teamwork. The
programming languages I learnt, have allowed me to use my projects as
my creative outlet. I am excited at the prospect of leveraging my skills
to help improve communities and make an impact.

***Below I will highlight some of my best projects***
